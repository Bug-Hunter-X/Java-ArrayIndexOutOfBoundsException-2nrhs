This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element using an invalid index.  The `bugSolution.java` file provides a corrected version that handles potential out-of-bounds issues.  This example highlights the importance of input validation and careful index management when working with arrays.
